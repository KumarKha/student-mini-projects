## ðŸŽ¯ Why These Projects?

Many students love to open up Inspect Element and pretend they're "hacking Google"â€”so we channeled that curiosity into something real. These projects give students a taste of real-world web scraping, showing how the tools behind Inspect can be used programmatically to gather and analyze data.
